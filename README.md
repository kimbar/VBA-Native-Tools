# SHA-2 256 developement branch

## Summary

This is for the main branch welcome `README.md`

```md
## CSHA256

SHA-2 256 hashing algorithm native implementation.
```

## Developement

- **2022-04-27**: The `csha256-optim` branch has been merged into this branch. The performance was about doubled (from
about 0.15MB/s to 0.32MB/s - values just for reference, YMMV), so now we're probably in the stage of diminishing
returns without some major redesign.
- **2022-04-30**: API implemented and tested
- **2022-05-02**: Documentation finalized, examples tested

## TODO

- merge and release
