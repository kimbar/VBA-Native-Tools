# CHSA256.UpdateStringPureASCII (method)

Append the buffer of the data being processed with a string **strictly** restricted to 00-7F code-points

```VB
Public Sub UpdateStringPureASCII( _
    ByRef data As String, _
    ByVal errnum As Integer, _
    Optional ByRef cursor As Long = 1 _
    )
```

## Parameters

- `data` - (`ByRef String`) - string being hashed, the variable is not modified in the method
- `errnum` - (`ByVal Integer`) - number of an error which is raised when non-ASCII character is encountered
- `cursor` - (`ByRef Long`) - starting character index, see also "Return values" section

## Return values

- `cursor` - (`Long`) - location at which the upload was stopped (either normally or by an error)

## Raises

- `errnum` - if non-ASCII character has been found

## Remarks

At any char in the range 80-FFFF an error with number `errnum` is raised. The `cursor` variable can be used to find the
culprit. The hashing can be resumed after this.

## Examples

It's up to the user how to deal with non-ASCII characters. The simplest policy - removing them from the data on the fly - can be realized like this:

```VB
Dim oSHA256 As CSHA256: Set oSHA256 = New CSHA256
Dim data As String: data = "Witaj Åšwiecie!"
Dim cursor As Long: cursor = 1
Do
    On Error Resume Next
    oSHA256.UpdateStringPureASCII data, errnum:=1000, cursor:=cursor
    On Error GoTo 0
    cursor = cursor + 1    ' skipping non-ASCII characters
    If cursor > Len(data) Then Exit Do
Loop
Debug.Print oSHA256.DigestAsHexString
' prints:
' D05E082F1D7EFB2555EB468F2BA9F9E51E8A0F6BB050476C5133D6EDE35143B9
' hash identical to the hash of "Witaj wiecie!"
```
